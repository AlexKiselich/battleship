1. Iteration 3 did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach designing this iteration? If you did not get to Iteration 3, reflect on how you think you wouldâ€™ve approached the design and problem solving process.
  
 - We used it as a map to understand what we needed to do first (using some key words in our code). Using the box examples as a blueprint for what the user needs to veiw/ interact with.

2. If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on?

 - Alex: I would work on making our computer smarter!
 - Justin: I would want to refactor our code to make it as simple and efficient as possible. I would want each type of action to be it's own method.

3. Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project.

 - We did a lot of driver/navigator pairing. We also communicated at length when we got stuck while incorpoarting psuedo code/notes. 
  
 - Legit holding hands and saying good job more than we can count! :)

4. Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project.

 - Alex: Everytime someone suggested an idea/try something new, there was never a fear of being shotdown/unheard. We employed a "let's try it out" approach.
 - Justin: We communicated incredibly effectively and by happenstance were usually on the same page with scheduling, even when one or the other needed a break or time away from the computer.
